PROBLEMS (5.3.2022): 
 - Login page does not open for very strange reason. It worked already at first, but suddenly stopped working.
 - Login button should maybe be added to navigation bar. There was no introductions to do that.
   Now login is only available by typing localhost:8000/login (expect some problem)
